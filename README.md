# Emoji-prediction-using-sentiment-analysis
This README provides a detailed overview of the Emoji Prediction project using Sentiment Analysis with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for text data. This project aims to predict appropriate emojis based on the sentiment of input text data using deep learning techniques.

## Introduction
Emojis are widely used to convey emotions and sentiments in text messages and social media posts. This project leverages LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict appropriate emojis based on the sentiment of the input text. It aims to enhance user experiences in applications that involve text-based communication by automatically suggesting emojis that match the mood of the text.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (or PyTorch)
Numpy
Pandas
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK or spaCy)
Pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
Emoji dataset (for training and evaluation)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should consist of text samples labeled with corresponding emojis. You can create a custom dataset or use publicly available sentiment datasets. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately for training.

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing is a crucial step to prepare the text data for training. It typically includes:

Tokenization: Splitting text into words or subword units.
Padding: Ensuring all input sequences have the same length.
Encoding: Converting words or subword units into numerical representations.
Label Encoding: Mapping emojis to numerical labels.
The preprocessing.py script in the repository provides functions to perform these preprocessing steps.

## Model Architecture
The core of this project is the LSTM-based neural network for sentiment analysis and emoji prediction. The model architecture may include:

Embedding Layer: To convert words into dense vectors.
LSTM Layer(s): Capturing sequential patterns in the text data.
Dense Layer: Making emoji predictions based on LSTM outputs.
You can customize the architecture in the model.py file based on your requirements.
